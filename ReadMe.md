# Best-First-and-Simulated-Annealing-Algorithms-with-optimization
Using these two algorithms to solve Travelling Salesman Problems.

Instructions: 

Run the program in any Java Platform.

Choose the search strategy at first.

Choose the cost function from C1, C2, C3 (Cost Functions can be edited as you want).

Then input number of cities you want to search for (Do not enter more than 200 if your machine is out of date).

Start searching automatically.......

Output the result.

Description:

      TAP is a old problem that has been solved by many of other researchers. Anyway, the cities in this program are not real cities. I just denoted them as numbers with cost functions to get their distances. You can change the cities and the cost functions to real if you want to do some real world searching.
